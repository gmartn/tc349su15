  <h3>A cooperative is a type of business that is owned and operated for the mutual benefit of its members.
    This is done through being a democratic organization where members have full ownership and control over
    their earnings and assets.
    <br><br>The SHC is a housing cooperative where residents own and maintain their own houses,
     but there are a variety of other types of cooperatives such as credit unions, worker cooperatives,
     and consumer cooperatives.

    <br><br> By contributing and becoming an active member of a co-op, you have the power to shape that business.
     You control the politics and economics of what is truly your organization. </h3>
